        <p> San Elijo Middle School is a really enjoyable place to learn. It is busy with student from all around the community getting from class to class. The teachers make learning fun and engaging. With the right learning tools and environment this school is great and can get you to who you want to be. There are also after school programs where you cna learn extra things or keep up on school work.<br>I recommend this school because of all the fun and entertaining learning can make every students learning expeiece good. And the activities you can do after school like homework club, sports for sports teams, and even more fun clubs. Everyone grows into Golden Eagles!</p>
